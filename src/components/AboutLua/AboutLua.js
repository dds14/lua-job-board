              Lua was started by former bootcamp graduates. We didn't know the
              difference between Java and JavaScript when we started our journey
              to becoming developers. We saw firsthand how difficult the path to
              enter the tech industry can be.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              From learning how to become a developer (or designer, or data
              scientist!), to actually becoming one, there's not many good
              resources to help you on the journey - and that's a problem.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Our goal is to help solve this, and provide a resource for you to
              break into the tech industry without a CS degree.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              From your first line of code, to your first job offer, we hope to
              help guide you along the way.
              <br></br>
