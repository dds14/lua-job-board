              Lua is a community for anyone that wants to break into the tech
              industry as a developer, designer, or data scientist without a CS
              degree. We provide resources for bootcamp graduates and
              self-taught coders to navigate the job market, find jobs, and land
              them.
            </p>
            <p>As of right now, we provide the following resources:</p>
            <h4 className="about-lua-resource-list">
              ðŸ’» A job board, that only displays jobs that don't require CS

              Lua was started by former bootcamp graduates. We saw firsthand how
              difficult the journey can be. From not knowing how to write a line
              of code, to landing fully remote developer positions within a
              year, we learned a lot along the way.
