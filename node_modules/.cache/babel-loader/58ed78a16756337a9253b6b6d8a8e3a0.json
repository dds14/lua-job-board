Slightly joking… YouTube is honestly my favorite place\n              to get information on technologies I am learning because I am a\n              visual learner. I like seeing someone explain the code in detail,\n              so I can code along and get used to what I am working on, always\n              with the docs open in another tab. Favorite channels include\n              Clement Mihailescu and Programming with Mosh.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              StackOverflow is great for weird bugs I may be working on. Often\n              I’ll paste into the search bar the exact error I am looking at,\n              and it just pops up on StackOverflow. Thank you dev angels!\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Twitter is where all the devs hang out and is a great place to\n              keep up with trends in tech. I’d advise following prominent devs\n              that use technologies that you use and go from there!
