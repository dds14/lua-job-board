Thanks for having me by the way, I appreciate your time.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              So I’m Dallas born and bred. I graduated SMU in 2017, where I\n              studied Economics and Advertising. After graduating, I worked for\n              my family’s business in the service industry, where I helped\n              manage a bar for two years. That was enough time to decide I\n              wanted something different, and it sure wasn’t going to be a\n              career in Finance.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              It was then that I’d developed an interest in coding video games\n              in my spare time. I built a space shooter kind of like Galaga and\n              a platformer as well. That experience got me hooked on coding so I\n              looked into potential careers and boot camps.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>I decided web development was the right choice for me and\n              I signed up for DevMountain after about three months of coding and\n              researching on my own. It definitely has been one of the best\n              decisions I’ve ever made.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Outside of programming, I am an active musician, songwriter, and\n              producer. Mostly indie guitar pop and rock. I am also a Nintendo\n              fanboy and a wannabe photographer\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <h2 className=\"blog-paragraph-header\">\n            Would you say that having a background in a different field, like\n            economics, is beneficial when becoming a developer?\n            <br></br>\n          </h2>\n          <div className=\"blog-paragraph-div\">\n            <p>\n              Oh absolutely! Economics is very heavy on math and theory, so that\n              computational and logical way of thinking has served me very well\n              in picking up the more technical side of being a dev.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Advertising taught me the importance of having the consumer and\n              their needs in mind, and at Match and all consumer-facing product\n              companies that’s what drives decisions every day.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Lastly, I’d say working in a bar for two years has actually been\n              incredibly helpful! The people skills I learned in the service\n              industry have been crucial in being able to work in teams. So\n              thankful I did that, and I’ll carry those lessons with me always.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <h2 className=\"blog-paragraph-header\">\n            You are extremely passionate about music. Were you able to integrate\n            your passion for music with learning to code?\n            <br></br>\n          </h2>\n          <div className=\"blog-paragraph-div\">\n            <p>\n              Definitely. One of the first things we were told when starting the\n              course at DevMountain was that there’d be a personal project. I\n              knew immediately what I wanted to make. I had an idea for a\n              file-management and versioning app for music producers.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Essentially as a user, you could post a music project you were\n              working on and invite your friends onto that project. Your friend\n              could then download the project, tweak it, re-upload to the site\n              and the site would create a new version entry under that project’s\n              page. That way you’d never tarnish the original or any subsequent\n              versions. This allows the user to see the progression of their\n              project and jump back to any previous version just in case they\n              liked a certain mix better or preferred a certain vocal take, for\n              example.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>I called the app TapeDeck. I look back on it now and it’s\n              pretty buggy! But I loved it at the time and it ended up winning\n              Best Overall Personal Project at DevMountain.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <h2 className=\"blog-paragraph-header\">\n            What are your favorite online resources? Are there any Youtube\n            channels or blogs you would recommend?\n            <br></br>\n          </h2>\n          <div className=\"blog-paragraph-div\">\n            <p>\n              TECHLEAD. Slightly joking… YouTube is honestly my favorite place\n              to get information on technologies I am learning because I am a\n              visual learner. I like seeing someone explain the code in detail,\n              so I can code along and get used to what I am working on, always\n              with the docs open in another tab. Favorite channels include\n              Clement Mihailescu and Programming with Mosh.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              StackOverflow is great for weird bugs I may be working on. Often\n              I’ll paste into the search bar the exact error I am looking at,\n              and it just pops up on StackOverflow. Thank you dev angels!\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Twitter is where all the devs hang out and is a great place to\n              keep up with trends in tech.

We’d learn concepts and use them that day and\n              often not get back to them for another week or so. The way I got\n              past that was by keeping calm and trying to not let myself get\n              overwhelmed, which is easier said than done.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>I would tell myself that it’s okay if I didn’t grasp a\n              concept that day, but I sure as hell would learn the syntax. By\n              repeating and practicing syntax first, my understanding of the\n              concepts came with time.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Might not be the best way, but that was my approach and it’s\n              served me well even in my current gig.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n          <h2 className=\"blog-paragraph-header\">\n            After graduating from DevMountain bootcamp, how did you land your\n            first job as a developer?\n            <br></br>\n          </h2>\n          <div className=\"blog-paragraph-div\">\n            <p>\n              I was fortunate enough to meet a Match recruiter at one of\n              DevMountain’s Meet and Hire events during my mentorship.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              The recruiter was about to leave but he spotted my Pokedex project\n              that I’d built and he walked over to me.
