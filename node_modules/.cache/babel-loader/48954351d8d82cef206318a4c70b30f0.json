Build as many projects as\n              you can and you will be surprised by your improvement.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Even if it’s the boring To-Do list app we all love, make it\n              prettier and more badass each time you build it. Or take my idea\n              and build a Pokedex!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <Footer />\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
